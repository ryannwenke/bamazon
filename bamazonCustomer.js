//Display all items for sale

//Prompt users with two messages
//First ask item ID
//Then ask how many units they would like to purchase

//If not, app should say Insufficient quantity! and prevent order from going through

//If the store does have enough, order should go through
	//Update SQL database to reflect remaining quantity
	//Once update goes through, show customer total cost of their order
